⚡ About me:

I love developing my skills and learning new things in all kinds of things.
Currently I am working as an IT-Administrator. Over the few years I grew bored of it and want to delve deeper into the code. So I started in my free time with python coding and am more motivated than ever to do a career change and learn more about coding 🌠
